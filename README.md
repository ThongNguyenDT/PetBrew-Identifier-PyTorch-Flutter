<h2 align="center">Overview</h2>

PetBrew-Identifier-PyTorch-Flutter is a project aimed at pet breed identification using object detection techniques. This repository contains code for training and deploying a PyTorch-based model for identifying various pet breeds on the Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset. The project also includes a Flutter-based mobile application for real-time breed identification using the trained model.

The model can detect pet breeds in real-time using a device's camera or on images from the device's gallery. Importantly, it runs natively on the device, eliminating the need for server-side processing for breed detection.
